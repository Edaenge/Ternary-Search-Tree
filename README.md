# Ternary-Search-Tree

*** Requires Graphviz installed ***
- Add environment value to "PATH" variable. Should be Graphviz bin folder (X:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin).
- Add a new environment variable called "GRAPHVIZ_DOT", and set its value to dot.exe (X:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe).

May have to manually change startup project to GUI.exe if it complains about C++.dll / CLI.dll on run.
